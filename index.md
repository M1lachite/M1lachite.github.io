Bio:
==========

Kristof started his self-taught journey in IT as he found interest and pure joy in this field, especially in servers and cloud area.

All the skills which he gained in recent years working outside the IT area allowed him to master time management and consistency in working on projects which created a strong foundation to develop a system of learning fast, including complex topics.

Over past year he gained knowledge in administrating Linux server and Bash scripting which he constantly improves on his small home laboratory.

Right now, the scope of his interest of topics to learn oscillates towards networking and cloud computing with using standard tools in the area including Python, Docker, Ansible and Terraform.

After hours, he is crafting his skills in a music area as sound engineer on his own instrumental and field recordings.
