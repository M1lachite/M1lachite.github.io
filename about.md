Hi, I'm Kristof! I’m working towards becoming a Cloud Engineer, and this blog is where I document my progress. I focus on cloud technologies, networking, and automation. Currently, I’m diving into Linux administration, Bash scripting, and tools like Python, Docker, Ansible, and Terraform.

Through this blog, I’ll share my learning experiences, challenges, and breakthroughs as I build my skills and work on real-world projects. My goal is to make complex topics easier to understand, both for myself and for others on a similar journey.

Join me as I explore new technologies, solve problems, and grow in my cloud engineering career.
